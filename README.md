    <td width="50%"><p>As a software developer with over four years of hands-on experience in React and TypeScript, I have a deep-rooted passion for technology and innovation. My journey began in a modest Brazilian community and led me to diverse roles in fintech, e-commerce, and groundbreaking projects in Tallinn, like muography software development to display billions of data in a nice 3D view 💅. I thrive on the challenges that new projects and emerging technologies bring, viewing them as opportunities to evolve both personally and professionally. Beyond technical expertise, I bring a unique blend of design acumen and a strong belief in teamwork, making me a versatile asset to any forward-thinking team.</p>
